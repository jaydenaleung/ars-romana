# Ars Romana - RPG Turn-Based Creature-Catching-Style Game for AP Latin (2025)

**Play it here: [https://loliipoppi.itch.io/ars-romana](url)**

## Description
This is a Prodigy/Pokemon-style game where you spawn at the first route and progress through routes, towns, and bosses to complete the game. Throughout the game are creatures that can be caught by answering questions about the AP Latin content, and teachers can assign work in the game. This tool is designed to be used in coordination with the 2025 AP Latin curriculum as either homework or practice; it can be used to either learn or practice the AP material.

The project was started at Daydream Boston 2025, a hackathon part of the global Daydream hackathon series hosted by Hack Club, and it was made with Godot 4. I made it because I had a really cool idea of combining Latin with entertainment, and some of my inspiration came from _Organic Chemistry_, another game made in Hack Club. It's an ongoing project which I hope to propose to my school and then the College Board to serve all AP Latin students!

_Route 1... start your adventure!_

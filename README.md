# Ars Romana - RPG Turn-Based Creature-Catching-Style Game for AP Latin (2025)

## Description
This is a Prodigy/Pokemon-style game where you spawn at the first route and progress through routes, towns, and bosses to complete the game. Throughout the game are creatures that can be caught by answering questions about the AP Latin content, and teachers can assign work in the game. This tool is designed to be used in coordination with the 2025 AP Latin curriculum as either homework or practice; it can be used to either learn or practice the AP material.

The project was started at Daydream Boston 2025, a hackathon part of the global Daydream hackathon series hosted by Hack Club.
